This is a note for pixymon installation. .
.
On GitHub it is written that qt4 is required to install pixymon for linux, but you neet qt5 to install it otherwise it will prompt you an error. 
.
Without qt5 pixymon cannot be installed on Ubuntu.. if you using manjaro just install pixymon directly via package manager
Cheers.. Enjoy .
